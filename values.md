### Profits are exhaust.

We are a mission-driven company. We believe that profits are an important tool in the pursuit of our mission, but they are not the mission itself.

### We contribute to the knowledge loop.
The highest goal of any human is to produce new knowledge that can subsequently be built upon by others. This is the process upon which every good thing in human society has been built. We participate in this most fundamental of human endeavors by thinking in public and defaulting to open source.

### We are more concerned with value creation than value capture.

### Work done well conveys dignity.

### Transparency always wins.
There are countless examples of choices that we all have in our professional lives of just how honest we want to be. We choose to be completely honest, even when that is uncomfortable, or even when it would lead to short-term negative consequences. We believe that transparency is a north star, and that acting transparently is always in the long-term best interests of achieving our mission.

### We value diversity.
People with different mindsets and experiences, working together, create better outcomes. This includes diversity of race and gender, as well as the diversity of academic backgrounds, socio-economic backgrounds, geographic backgrounds, ideologies, and interests.

### Users are our best salespeople.
We market our products and services by working with amazing humans, making them incredibly happy, and asking them to spread the word. We go above and beyond for our clients / users to invest in our future growth.

### We are humble.
While we believe that we are building somoething exceptional, that knowledge does not make us feel proud, it makes us feel humble. It imbues us with a deep sense of responsibility towards our clients, coworkers, and the community at large.

### We’re invested in the future of work.
The employee-employer relationship of the 1900’s is a thing of the past. We fully embrace the future of work.

- We believe that employees should be able to work where and when they choose, assuming those choices are consistent with the effective performance of their responsibilities.
- We do not believe that employees should be asked to sign overly-aggressive non-competes, IP ownership contracts, or other terms that constrict their future choices excessively.
- We believe that compensation shouldn't create "handcuffs".

### We believe in moving up the stack.
We believe that all team members should seek to replace themselves on an ongoing basis by building processes, technology, and documentation that obviate their existing work. We have an abundance mindset: there is always more, and more valuable, work to do. Moving up the stack presents growth opportunities for both the individual and the team.

### Values are more important than success.
We are not interested in success absent the values in this document. We have strongly held opinions on how a company should be built and these are non-negotiable. We do not believe that these opinions are an absolute truth, but they are an absolute truth for us.
