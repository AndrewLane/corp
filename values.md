###Profits are exhaust.###
We are a mission-driven company. We do not exist to make a profit; rather, profit is a tool to help us accomplish our mission. Our mission is to promote and explore an opinionated way of doing analytics. We are the commercial instantiation of Analyst Collective. We believe that this is the way that analytics will be done in the future, and we want to help make that future a reality.

**This is a thing that has to be done.**

###We’re invested in the future of work.###
The employee-employer relationship of the 1900’s is a thing of the past. We fully embrace the future of work, including:
 - aggressively at-will employment (on both sides)
 - no contractual employment obligations that would make it challenging to fire, or to take work elsewhere (non-competes, stock options, aggressive IP ownership contracts)
 - remote work and flexible schedules
 - fractional attachment and 1099 relationships

###We value diversity.###
People with different mindsets and experiences, working together, create better outcomes. This includes diversity of race and gender, as well as the diversity of academic backgrounds, socio-economic backgrounds, geographic backgrounds, and interests.

###Work is hard.###
Work isn’t always fun. We are doing what we do for a long-term feeling of satisfaction, of accomplishment, of fulfillment—not for short term happiness or fun. We have a mission, and we’re mission-focused people.

###Transparency always wins.###
There are countless examples of choices that we all have in our professional lives of just how honest we want to be. We choose to be completely honest, even when that is uncomfortable, or even when it would lead to short-term negative consequences. We believe that transparency is a north star, and that acting transparently is always in the long-term best interests of achieving our mission.

###We contribute to the knowledge loop.###
The highest goal of any human is to produce new knowledge that can subsequently be built upon by others. This is the process upon which every good thing in human society has been built. We participate in this most fundamental of human endeavors by thinking in public and defaulting to open source.

###Clients are our best salespeople.###
We market our services by working with amazing clients, doing amazing work for them, and asking them to spread the word. We go above and beyond for our clients to invest in our future growth.

###We are humble.###
While we believe that we are an exceptional group of humans, that knowledge does not make us feel proud, it makes us feel humble. It imbues us with a deep sense of responsibility towards our clients, coworkers, and the community at large.

###Values are more important than success.###
We are not interested in success absent the values in this document. We have strongly held opinions on how a company should be built and these are non-negotiable. We do not believe that these opinions are an absolute truth, but they are an absolute truth for us. Failure to live up to these values could result in immediate re-evaluation of any kind of ongoing working relationship.
