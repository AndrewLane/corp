###Company Operating System###

####What is a company operating system?####

A company is made up of people. These people are compensated in some fashion to work towards the company's goals. In doing so, they make decisions and do work to implement those decisions.

These two activities—making decisions and doing work—are the two core activities of any company. Companies have certain processes by which they make decisions and do work. These processes, when considered in their totality, constitute the operating system of the company.

These processes are often unconscious: the company finds itself using a certain process without making an active decision to use it.



Switch this around: people > processes > operating system.
then, decisions + work = processesact
