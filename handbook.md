# The Fishtown Analytics Employee Handbook

## Welcome to Fishtown

Hello and Welcome to Fishtown Analytics. We’re thrilled to have you as a member of the team!

This handbook is intended to answer many of the questions you might have after joining, and should serve as a valuable resource throughout your employment at Fishtown Analytics. Read on to learn about important company policies and procedures, as well as the commitments of this company to our employees.

## Workplace Commitments

### Equal Opportunity Employment

Fishtown Analytics is an equal opportunity employer and does not unlawfully discriminate against employees or applicants for employment on the basis of an individual’s race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. This policy applies to all terms, conditions and privileges of employment, including recruitment, hiring, placement, compensation, promotion, discipline and termination. Whenever possible, the company makes reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities to the extent required by law. Employees who would like to request a reasonable accommodation should contact Drew Banin.

### Non-Harassment / Non-Discrimination Policy

Fishtown Analytics prohibits discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and is free from discriminatory practices, including, without limitation, harassment. Consistent with its workplace policy of equal employment opportunity, Fishtown Analytics prohibits and will not tolerate harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. Violations of this policy will not be tolerated.

Discrimination includes, but is not limited to: making any employment decision or employment-related action on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, age, sex, disability, national origin, marital or veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law. Harassment is generally defined as unwelcome verbal or nonverbal conduct, based upon a person’s protected characteristic, that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward the person because of the characteristic, and which affects the person’s employment opportunities or benefits, has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the person’s work performance, or has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets; slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; or denigrating jokes and display or circulation in the workplace of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group based on their protected characteristic.

Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when:

1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or 
3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

Examples of sexual harassment include: unwelcome or unsolicited sexual advances; displaying sexually suggestive material; unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances or propositions; suggestive comments; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; sexually-oriented jokes; crude or vulgar language or gestures; graphic or verbal commentaries about an individual’s body; display or distribution of obscene materials; physical contact such as patting, pinching or brushing against someone’s body; or physical assault of a sexual nature. 

### Complaint Procedure

**Any company employee who feels that they have been harassed or discriminated against, or has witnessed or become aware of discrimination or harassment in violation of these policies, should bring the matter to the immediate attention of Drew Banin or Erin Vaughan.** The company will promptly investigate all allegations of discrimination and harassment, and take action as appropriate based on the outcome of the investigation. An investigation and its results will be treated as confidential to the extent feasible, and permitted by law, and the company will take appropriate action based on the outcome of the investigation. No employee will be retaliated against for making a complaint in good faith regarding a violation of these policies, or for participating in good faith in an investigation pursuant to these policies. If an employee feels they have been retaliated against, the employee should file a complaint using the procedures set forth above.

### Open Door Policy

Fishtown Analytics has an open-door policy and takes employee concerns and problems seriously. The company values each employee and strives to provide a positive work experience. Employees are encouraged to bring any workplace concerns or problems they might have or know about to one of the designated members of the leadership team.

### Breach of Workplace Commitments

If Fishtown Analytics determines that a violation has occurred, we will take appropriate disciplinary action against the offending party, which can include counseling, warnings, suspensions, and termination. Employees who report, in good faith, violations of these policies and employees who cooperate with investigations into alleged violations will not be subject to retaliation.

**We take our commitment to our employees seriously, and we will not tolerate any breach of these commitments. Failure to abide by these commitments may cause you to lose your job. If you have any questions regarding these commitments, do not hesitate to seek clarification from Drew Banin or Erin Vaughan.**

## Company Policies and Procedures

### Trust and Flexibility

Fishtown Analytics trusts and respects its employees. With this trust comes flexibility. If you are unsure about appropriate conduct in a given situation, bias towards Doing The Right Thing, or consult your immediate supervisor for clarification.

### Code of Professional Conduct

Fishtown Analytics expects its employees to adhere to a standard of professional conduct and integrity. This ensures that the work environment is safe, comfortable and productive. Employees should be respectful, courteous, and mindful of others’ feelings and needs. General cooperation between coworkers and supervisors is expected. Individuals who act in an unprofessional manner may be subject to disciplinary action.

### Performance Reviews

Employees at Fishtown Analytics will participate in quarterly reviews and more frequent one-on-ones with their immediate supervisors. These reviews are a good opportunity to discuss employee performance, professional growth, and other big-picture topics.

### Dress Code

Employees are encouraged to dress comfortably for work, while also maintaining appropriate attire for a business setting. Please do not wear anything that other employees might find offensive or that might make coworkers uncomfortable. Our goal is to provide a workplace environment that is comfortable and inclusive for all employees.

We expect that your business attire, although casual, will exhibit common sense and professionalism. If you wouldn’t wear it in front of your grandmother, please don’t wear it to work! If you have any questions about what this means in practice, please consult your immediate supervisor.

While employees rarely need to travel for work, it is sometimes required. If you find yourself traveling to meet a client, be sure to ask about the dress code prior to your visit!

### Payday

Employees are paid on the 15th of the month, every month, for work done the month prior.

## Expense Policies

Many employees incur expenses over the course of their regular duties. We have two goals with these expense policies: a) make sure that there is accountability when spending company money, and b) make the process of spending money as frictionless as possible, given (a). Given these goals, we've arrived at the following policies.

- For distributed employees: please work with your manager to plan all trips to Philadelphia. Your manager will have a budget for travel and will work with you to create a travel frequency that works for you and for that budget.
- For all corporate travel, please refer to [these expense guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D6TciMqWz5E-4F9Nw3DuVOhvAfoEZDFZmtgHYFq2Uk0/edit?ts=5e287129#) when booking flights and hotels and expensing meals and other incidentals. 
- Most non-travel purchases should be able to be made by either a company office administrator or your manager; please feel free to make requests as appropriate via these channels. If you do have other items that you'd like to submit for reimbursement, make sure that you have approval from your manager before doing so, and use [this reimbursement form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhFJmx5JDbG0katCQoZ-1SOlZQ0EA2BOulcaOlu-0l4/edit#gid=444102166).
- In certain rare cases, if your job requires frequent expenditures of company money, you'll be issued a corporate American Express card to conduct company business. In such a case, your manager will work with you to define specific expectations around what will and will not be charged on this card, as well as a specific budget for these charges. Failure to abide by these expectations may result in disciplinary action, including termination, and in the worst case, criminal proceedings. **While we absolutely do not expect this to be an issue, it's important to be clear that misappropriation of our shared resources will be taken extremely seriously.**

## Attendance Policies

### Hours of Work

Fishtown Analytics does not have “required” working hours. There is an expectation that employees are in the office or available to remotely call in to required meetings and scheduled client calls. The company workweek is generally from Monday through Friday, with “normal operating hours” from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Employee’s personal operating hours may vary depending on client time zones and the nature of the projects that you’re working on.

### Time off

Fishtown Analytics has an unlimited paid vacation policy, allowing employees to take as much time off as they need. Employees should utilize this benefit in a way that is conducive to their productivity. We understand, appreciate (and encourage!) turning off your brain, traveling, and spending time with friends and family!

Employees are obligated to:

- Communicate and collaborate with their team to ensure everyone takes leave without disrupting operations.
- Notify their supervisor as soon as the absence is scheduled, and no less than one month  in advance of a full week of absence.
- Mark the planned time off on their Fishtown Analytics Google calendar as full day events so that other employees can effectively plan events or meetings.
- Avoid abusing the policy by taking time off that negatively impacts their job and the company.

### Working from home

Working from home can be a great idea in the event of inclement weather, errands, deliveries, etc. Further, working from home can can be great for productivity and stress management if you have many scheduled client calls or an impending deadline. Some of us can write code twice as fast with shoes and socks off, for instance. Whatever your reason, Fishtown Analytics values your ability to work from home.

Fishtown Analytics has a very flexible remote work policy. Employees are allowed to work from home as long as this is approved by their immediate supervisor, and such approval will not be unduly withheld. It may not be a good idea to work from home (and your supervisor may not approve) if your physical presence at work is important for a particular project or you are currently in your first few months on the job.

If you are working from home, you are expected to be actually working and available for both clients and team members to contact throughout the day. If you know that you will be working from home on a given day, please add an all-day event to your Google Calendar, and give a quick update the day of in Slack.

### Holidays

Fishtown Analytics observes the following federal holidays:

- New Year's Day (January 1)
- Memorial Day (Last Monday in May)
- Independence Day (July 4)
- Labor Day (First Monday in September)
- Thanksgiving Day (Fourth Thursday in November)
- Christmas Day (December 25)

The Fishtown Analytics sprint model operates on a pretty rigid two-week cadence. Sometimes, holidays interfere with the delivery of these sprints. When possible, employees should strive to deliver their sprints on or before their due dates. If holidays make this infeasible, then employees can push back their sprint delivery date. Please consult your manager (and the client) in the event that a holiday interferes with your sprint delivery.

## Leave Policies

Fishtown Analytics happily provides parental leave for both adoptive and natural parents.

Prior to the start of leave, the employee and Fishtown Analytics will create a Leave Plan. This plan will detail steps for a smooth transition back to work following the scheduled leave. The employee is expected to communicate with Fishtown Analytics if the Leave Plan needs to be amended while on leave.

Parental Leave includes the following benefits:  

- 100% of employee salary for the first one month of leave.
- Employees may request up to two months of additional unpaid leave.

Leave may also be used for medical procedures and bereavement. Speak with your immediate supervisor as soon as you’re aware of the need for extended leave.

## Background Checks

Fishtown Analytics is concerned about the safety of its team members and about maintaining appropriate controls to ensure that assets of Fishtown Analytics and our customer relationships and information are protected. To reduce these risks, we will obtain and review background information of covered prospective, and, as applicable, current employees.

Fishtown Analytics has contracted with Sterling Talent Solutions to perform these background checks, which will cover criminal history for the last 7 years and employment history for the last 5 years and/or the three most recent employers. Fishtown Analytics may use the returned background check information to make decisions regarding employment. For certain positions where the candidates financial history is relevant to the position, we may also run a check in the federal database for any financial related offenses.

All candidates who make it to the offer stage with Fishtown Analytics must undergo a background screening according to this policy as part of the employment screening process. All contracts will state that employment is subject to obtaining results from an approved background screening that are satisfactory to Fishtown Analytics. If a candidate is unwilling to follow this process we are unable to proceed with their candidacy for any position at Fishtown Analytics. In the event the background check is not available at the time of hire (switching vendors or delays in processing), Fishtown Analytics will run the background check as soon as possible. The same adjudication guidelines will apply to current employees as they do with prospective employees.

### Disclosure and Authorization

Candidates (as applicable, employees) will receive an email to fill out the background check application. The application will ask for personal and professional information. The application process includes signing a disclosure and a consent form which explains the rights of an individual undergoing a background examination. The application process is designed to take less than fifteen minutes to complete.

To prepare for the employment verification, candidates should gather each previous employer's name and address, position title held, employment start and end dates, manager’s name and title, their phone number, and email address. Details for a Human Resources contact can be entered instead of a manager's contact details.

Occasionally, Sterling will reach out to the candidate to retrieve additional information, such as backup documentation to act as proof of previous employment or picture IDs. Proof of employment can typically be provided in various ways, such as tax returns (e.g. W2s), pay stubs, LLC documentation, official company registrations, etc.

Background checks will act as an additional mechanism of transparency and will help to build trust with our clients.

### Review Criteria

Once the background check is completed, company administrators will review the report and determine if any negative information has a direct connection with an applicant’s ability to fulfill the job duties with competence and integrity. Criminal convictions that would raise a concern are job-related offenses, including but not limited to: embezzlement, extortion, computer/internet crime, fraud, tax evasion, and violent crimes. In addition, the report should be reviewed for omissions or inaccuracies contained in the employment application or made during the interview process.

## Employee Benefits

### Retirement Plan

Employees will have access to an employer-sponsored 401K plan. Immediately upon hire, Fishtown Analytics will contribute 3% of employee’s monthly salary into the retirement account on a monthly basis. Employees can additionally opt to contribute up to the federal maximum to their retirement account. Fishtown Analytics will contribute to the retirement account regardless of any supplemental employee contributions.

### Health Insurance

Fishtown Analytics provides medical, dental and vision benefits to employees and their dependents. Health benefits are paid in part by the company. The remainder of the costs is the employee’s responsibility. Please login to Gusto for additional information about available benefits.

### Stock Options

Some employees at Fishtown Analytics will be granted stock options as a part of their compensation package. Please ask your direct manager or Tristan if you have any questions about this topic.

### Office Expense Reimbursement

There are many advantages to building a remote-first culture. One of the more practical advantages is the savings on overhead costs (office space, furniture, etc.) for each employee. That being said, we understand that the cost of some of those things can, in turn, become a burden on the employee that now needs to set up a home office that is conducive to their work. This policy is to help mitigate some of that burden and pass our savings onto those team members.
